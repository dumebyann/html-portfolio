  his family among all.

<p>
  This is a korean coming of age love story between Na Hee Do and Baek Yi Jin.
  The chemistry was on point,excellent potrayal of emotions and including their
  relations with their friends. <br />
  In all, this drama teaches about love,friendship and relationship. you get a
  lot of butterflies in your tummy while watching it

  families fight for control over the Lands of Westeros, while an ancient enemy
  returns after being dormant for millenia.

  This korean series follows the lives of five families living on the same
  street in a neighbourhood called ssangmundong in seoul. It is a nostalgic look
  back at the year 1988.
